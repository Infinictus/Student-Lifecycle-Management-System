The Student Lifecycle Management System is a solution that aims to streamline and administrative tasks related to student management in educational institutions. The system includes two user types, students and administrators, with the latter having the ability to add and edit student records, attendance status, and department-wise details. The main objective of the project is to build a robust integrated student database system that can track and store student records while reducing administrative workload. It is developed using Flask, a micro web framework in Python, and uses SQL as the database management system. The frontend of the system is built using HTML and CSS for designing the user interface, while PHP is used to handle server-side processing and dynamic content generation. The system is also scalable and offers future development opportunities, posing as a worthwhile investment for any college seeking to optimize student lifecycle management.
